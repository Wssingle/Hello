# Mbed FRDM K64F : Bluetooth, LCD, Dust Sensor, Microphone; KDS Kw41Z UART on 802.15.4, AT&T M2X

This file contains a mix of mbed code written for the FRDM K64F on MBED OS as well as code written for the FRDM KW41Z Written on Kinetis Design Studio. The FRDM K64F code "End Sensor Device" Uses a super loop (yea i Know) to poll a microphone and dust sensor device, the state of these devices is sent over uart to a kw41z and also displayed on an LCD. The LCD uses a RGB backlight, and 3 transistors are used with GPIOs to get the red, green, and fun Island color schemes. This code also contains the necessary elements to send data over bluetooth, but the code to recieve it is not present on the M2X k64F..     
The KW41Z End device communicates with the K64F using its UART, and sends this data over the air using 802.15.4 to the Coordinator device which in turn uses its UART to communicate with another K64F. This Final K64F sends the data it recieves over UART to AT&T M2X. This code is massively Jury rigged and if you happen to come upon it I wish you the best of luck. The known problems are the fact that the AT&T M2X code is very finicky, and you will have to enable/disable your ethernet many times to get it to work. Also this whole system works on baud 9600. Finally, the KW41Z UART works on interrupts, so if you send massive amounts of data you will give it an interrupt storm and youll lose all your packets. Im not happy about it, but life is pretty brutal sometimes.
